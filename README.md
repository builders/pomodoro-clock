A JavaScript Pomodoro Clock

This Pomodoro clock started out as a challenge on freeCodeCamp.
I have been tracking my [progress](https://github.com/bauhouse/freecodecamp-challenges/tree/master/frontend/projects/pomodoro-clock) as a full stack developer on GitHub.
I posted the results of my [Pomodoro clock](https://codepen.io/bauhouse/pen/aKGWvP) experiment to Codepen.
Then, I discovered Glitch through freeCodeCamp. This repository is intended to be hosted on Glitch.

## Build a Pomodoro Clock

- Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/XpKrrW.
- Fulfill the user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
